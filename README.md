<h1>ProjCpp</h1>
<p>
Right now this extension places a <b>Run</b> button in the editor actions, that attempts to find or download a c++ compiler (the downloaded one is MinGW). </p>
<p>
After downloading (and extracting to desired location), it is prepended to the Path variable.
</p>
<p>
After that succeeded, the code is hopefully compiled and then run in a VSCode terminal.
